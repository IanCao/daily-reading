# Common Performance Review Biases: How to Spot and Counter Them
- 本文介绍了在绩效评审中经常出现的偏见，也提到了如何识别并解决。
## How Specific Feedback are You Getting?
- Specific feedback
  - follow the pattern of OFNR Observation, Feeling, Need, Request
  - a tailored version of the STAR model (Situation, Task, Action, Result）
  - 有利于健康的交流，分享miss context， 消除一些误解
- Generic feedback
  - your work is often lower quality than what it should be（should be what）
  - frustrating to hear hard to pin down
  -  paraphrase the generic feedback 
  - ask for examples
- Speculative feedback
  - tells you things that you could do or could have done, often without much specifics
  - Speculative feedback is often a lazy form of feedback 感觉有时候我经常产出这种feedback，需要注意一下
  - challenge why your manager is saying this

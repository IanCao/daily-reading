## Before we started

If I did not count this wrong, I will meet the performance review for Q4 in 2 weeks, which is my second times to do so. Quite excited, cus I thought I did not bad, and indeed a lot in the past two and half months. Hence, it is well-resoned that I choose to read this article :)

Hope I could get what I deserved by learning more communication skills after reading this one.

## Unconscious Biases

Biases are common things for human as we are not perfectly a rational person. I have ever seen gender bias, appearance bias, race bias, territory bias and etc. People tends to pre-define other people and then looks for similarities during the normal process to **prove** their previous definition, which gives them a subtle reward like "Bingo". Therefore, they often ignore those signs that does not match their previouse definition to win more "Bingo" game. 

This kind of behavior is dangerous in many situations. Interviewers may miss excellent candidates. Manager may under- or over-qualified employees that either way will discourage team members and lower the productivity. The best way to combat unconscious biases is to

1. Know as many kind of biases as possible, serving as the prerequisite to notice when happened
2. Consciously introspect any assertion I am about to make: Is this judgement made purely out of the performance of the target person within a specific length of time?
3. Evaluate the whole process afterward, maybe with your peer or manager and maybe using STAR model, and then summarize any potential biases.

As a employee, getting feedback from our manager is crucial for detecting biases. Specific feedback is easy to challenge when we think this does not match the fact or could not describe my working status. However, we need to be sharp on generic feedback or speculative feedback. Either one is a strong a strong smell for biases. If we found the feedback we get is generic or speculative, without concrete arguments and examples to support his/hers decision, especially with a negative tune, we could ask for a specific explanation to pin down to specific matters to avoid misunderstanding and know the direction to improve. However, if the manager failed to show specific cases immediately on what he is talking about, it would be highly possible that the manager has kind of biases.

### What are those biases?

From the employee's point of view: 

1. Recency bias
   - Phenomenon: Weigh the most recent events in the past one or two months a lot more than the events before in the review period
   - A way out: Keep a log of the work you do
2. Strictness bias
   - Phenomenon: Be overly strict in evaluation with a few people that hold you to higher standards than others
   - A way out: Ask for specifics to talk about and have regular catchups where you talk about your work
3. Leniency bias: Opposite to #3
4. Horns bias
   - Phenomenon: Unfairly pull the whole performance review down because of one negative attribute or behavior being generalized
   - A way out: Identify what this big, negative trait or behavior might be, and post re-review question to manager if that negative thing had not occurred.
5. Halo bias: Opposite to #4
6. Similarity bias
   - Phenomenon: Tend to favor employees who look or feel similar to them. This can result in leniency and halo biases for those a manager "feels" closer with, and strictness and horns biases for those who they not.
   - A way out: Spend more time with the manager and hope they could realize this by themself. Or just leave :)
7. Central tendency bias
   - Phenomenon: Tempt to give even or close performance review to everyone in the team
   - A way out: Push the manager to identify your strength and a growth area
8. The contrasting bias
   - Phenomenon: Compare you with others, instead of with objective expectations
   - A way out: Ask for objective review without referring

## At The End

Performance review is a good chance to look bach what I have done and more importantly what value I have produced in the past give time. On the other hand, it is a good time to introspect yourself as well. Am I walking to the target as planed? If not, what did I miss or do wrong and how could I avoid the same mistake from happening? Could I done better on something? Performance review supposes to be a push to one's growth as long as the feedback is actionable.

At this point, I suddenly remind that I forgot to write 1-on-1 note this week. I will make it up right away T_T.

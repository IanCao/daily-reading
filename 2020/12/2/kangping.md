# Attention is your scarcest resource

Like many of us, the author has a tendency to spend time/attention/resources on the stuff, with which he/she is the most comfortable, in this particular case, programming/software design. In my personal case, it would be some arithmetic/mathematical optimization program. 

In author's case though, this means he did not spend enough time thinking about managing his reports. (Same applies to me.) This resulted in that the author reverted to be a individual contributor after a short period of time.

The author then sited Byrne Hobart's observation: 

1. <10% focus on the job => getting fired
2. 10-50% focus => average
3. 50%+ focus => superstar

I believe the goal for most of us is bullet point 3.

The author's advise on achieving 50%+ focus is that yout need to be intuitively/emotionally invested in the outcome, which is sometimes hard. (I feel the same, especially when you had been woring on something similar for a period of time.)

For the author, the remedy comes in the form of the following three categories.

1. Monotask. even when you get stuck. (Personaly, this had never been my approach. In my working environment, multi-task had always been required, and I felt this would be quite typically for small group environment. However, as the group/team's workflow becomes more stable/established, monotasking may indeed be more fruitful.)

2. Evade obligation. Certain type of person would automatically take on whatever projects purposed to them if they believe those projects are advantages in general, and doing so without carefully calculating if one's focus/resources are already constrained. The author recommends only taking on additional project when you are not a critical part of it, and spend your focus/resources on the primary objective. (I agree with this approach in general, but felt it would be hard to execute from a personality point of view.)

3. Timebox bullshit. Budget your chores! Set a max amount of time you can spend on minor obligations. The author suggest a few hours per week. Good advice. Let's see if this can be executed properly. (Avoid text/instant message! and god forbid social network platforms. )
